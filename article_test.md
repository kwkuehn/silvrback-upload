Oblate WordPress Theme

This is the code for my website, open source for your inspiration. It's not meant for installation or customization - a lot of Tania-specific data is hard-coded into it. I encourage you to be unique and create your own theme. If you don't know how to do so, here is the tutorial.
External resources

    Syntax highlighting via Prism
    Task running via Gulp
    Roboto font via Google Fonts

Directory Structure

    Theme files are all located in wp-content/themes/oblate
    Source files are located in src folder
    Running gulp command applies a Sass watch to source files and compiles to theme files
