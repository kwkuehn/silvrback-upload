# This Week I Learned

## Business

1. I have learned an interesting perspective on being an enterpreneur.  

  > "… just because I’m an entrepreneur, it doesn’t mean the highest and best use of my time right now is building my own business."
  
  Why working on someone else can be beneficial: 
  
  1. Paid education.
  
    > " …to this day I probably spend 50 percent of my time just learning and testing new ideas, and I get paid for every minute of it."
    
  1. Accountability.
  
    > "… having a leader consistently drive you to be the best you can be is not a liability — it’s an incredible asset"
    
  1. Play a bigger game.
  
    > "… by jumping on board a larger company, I'm able to leverage myself into a much larger sandbox and have a lot more fun with the results."
  
  1. Meaningful relationships.
  
    > "By working with a company, I am able to build meaningful relationships that help both personally and professionally."
  
  1. More disposable income.
    > "By working a day job, I am able to substantially increase the amount of income, but at the same time keep my expenses constant at “pre-job” levels."

1. I've learned what traits are shared among successfull companies.  
  Seems to be too much, to be honest. But I can see some outstanding value in those.
  
  - Obsessed with quality/experience
  - Obsessed with talent
  - Can explain the vision for the company in a few clear words
  - Generate revenue very early on
  - Keep expenses low
  - User love.
  
    > Successful startups nearly always start with an initial core of super happy users that become very dependent on their product, and then expand from there.  The strategy of something that starts with something a huge number of people sort of like empirically does not work as well.
    
  - Grow organically
  - They do things that don't scale
  - They prioritize well
  - The founders are nice, move fast and get stuff done

1. A hilarious set of advices on interview process.   
  Some of them feel quite familiar, though…  
  The main idea: **Make those interviewees suffer!**  
  
  **Source: [Here are the Top Tech Companies’ Secrets to Hiring the Best People](https://medium.com/conquering-corporate-america/here-are-the-top-tech-companies-secrets-to-hiring-the-best-people-33f432c39db2#.b3iy38vcu)**
  
1. I've learned a nice opinion on **hiring A-players**.

  Things to look after:
  
  - Promotions in the past. Growth patterns
  
  - Challenging projects (bigger challenges)
  
  - Role changes (new challenges)
  
  - Like/Dislike the company (analysis + opinion for changes)
  
  - Confidence w/o cockiness 
  
  - What questions do they ask

## Self-Development
  
1. I've got throught a Microsoft training on **unconscious bias**.  
  Quite an interesting topic and a good training, which is available freely online.

1. **Carpe Diem.**  

  One more story which may change the perspective.  
  > "So every time I'm blessed with another day where I wake up, I'm going to make the most out of it."  
  
  **Source: [What is the one thing that motivates you in life whenever you think about it?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-one-thing-that-motivates-you-in-life-whenever-you-think-about-it)**

1. How to stop **being average**? 

  - Perseverance.  
    Everyone sucks in the beginning. It's what you do after the beginning that counts.
    
  - Awesomeness is contagious.  
    Spend time with those people, who crush it in life. 
    
  - Purpose.  
    Purpose will fuel your motivation
    
  - Focus on getting started.  
    The inertia will keep you going.
    
  - Life is short.  
    Make the most out of your time here.

1. How to change yourself to **an early bird**?  
  The main idea is **"To get up early you need to change the way you think about getting up early"**  

  > Mindset is everything. When I assumed I would wake up tired, I would. When I changed how I thought about waking up, it all changed for me.

## Psychology

1. I found the answer on a question *"Why clever people avoid relationships?"*.
  > "It simply boils down to fear of wasting time. There seems to be an unconscious need to reserve creative/mental/emotional energy and relationships require energy/effort. Effort requires time. Time is an investment. Relationships are high risk investments and because of that fact alone we're just highly selective. ;) IMO!" 
  
  I have the same idea :)
  
  **Source: [Why do many high IQ people avoid personal relationships?](https://www.quora.com/Psychology-of-Everyday-Life-Why-do-many-high-IQ-people-avoid-personal-relationships)**

1. Another interesting quora question shed some light on **why people are perceived being arrogant**.  

  - *If you say that you are smart* or have a high IQ, people will automatically assume you are arrogant
  
  - You can be arrogant by *thinking you are better than other people*.
  
  - People will think you are arrogant, when in reality *you are insecure and feel inferior to others*.
  
  - Some people are simply *uncomfortable around very smart people*, similar how some low level employees get uncomfortable around the CEO and executives in their company.
  
  - The person with the high IQ *may have a low EQ*, which is causing interpersonal issues.

  **Source: [If you have a very high IQ, why do some people immediately assume you are arrogant and treat you differently?](https://www.quora.com/If-you-have-a-very-high-IQ-why-do-some-people-immediately-assume-you-are-arrogant-and-treat-you-differently)**

1. Gender Bias.  
  > Students at Columbia University were presented with a business case study for Heidi Roizen, a real-world CEO, and asked to rate their impressions of her. A separate section of the class received the same case study, but with the name changed to a man's name — Howard. The group that received the case study with the male name judged "Howard" more positively than the same identical study with Heidi's actual name on it. Students judged Heidi as more power hungry and self-promoting and less liable than Howard.

1. Names on resumes may cause bias for an interviewer.  

  > A name on a resume can imply one's race/ethnicity, nationality and characteristics associated with these groups. Research by the US National Bureau of Economic Research, as well as a Canadian study, found that ethnic names can have a significant influence on the evaluation of resumes. The studies found significant differences in the number of callbacks for interviews between Asian, Hispanic, Black, and White-sounding names, when used on identical resumes.

## Software Development

1. I've read some nice tips from Eric Elliot on how to become a programmer and not get into many traps at the beginning.  
  A lot of self-promotion (as usual in Eric's posts), but still worth reading.

  **Source: [Learn to Code: 13 Tips that Could Save You Years of Effort](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/learn-to-code-13-tips-that-could-save-you-years-of-effort-92ce799a3e1f#.20zpqdmrw)**

1. An opinion on NIH and a sane approach to working with open source libraries, showing some tradeoffs.

  **Source: [Not Invented Here vs Never Invented Here](https://medium.com/@ayasin/from-not-invented-here-to--invented-here-1fd40e462553#.bhxs11pua)**
  
1. An interesting description how data scientists in AirBnB organized the process around reproducible knowledge sharing.  

  Problem: 
  
  - > "As an organization grows, how do we make sure that an insight uncovered by one person effectively transfers beyond the targeted recipient?"
  
  - > "The cost of transmitting knowledge across teams and across time increases."

  Solution: 
  
  - Knowledge Repo = Reproducibility + Quality + Consumability + Discoverability + Learning
  
  - Git Repo + (R + Jupiter + Markdown) + metadata -> internal blog
  
  - > "Our process combines the code review of engineering with the peer review of academia, wrapped in tools to make it all go at startup speed."
